# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Calculation

This script calculates the length of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two strings. The LCS is the longest subsequence that appears in both strings in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively.

## Features

- **Calculate LCS Length**: Computes the length of the longest common subsequence between two input strings.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts the user to input two strings and then calculates their LCS length.

## How to Use

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python 2 installed on your system.
2. **Running the Script**: Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python LCS.py
   ```
3. **Input Strings**: The script will prompt you to input two strings.
4. **Output**: The script will calculate and display the length of the longest common subsequence between the two input strings.

## Functions

- `get_LCS_Length(s1, s2)`: Takes two strings as input and returns the length of their longest common subsequence.
- `largest_common_string()`: Prompts the user for two strings and computes their LCS length.

## Example

To calculate the LCS of two strings:
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python LCS.py
   ```
2. When prompted, enter the first string.
3. Enter the second string.

The script will display the length of the longest common subsequence between the two strings.
